# Pokemon Pokedex
This is a React-Native application that uses the Pokemon TCG API by Andrew Backes.

The application fetches pokemon cards from the API and displays them. 

The user then has the capability of liking a pokemon card and adding it to their personal favorites.

Currently the app has been built for web and ios use and has yet to be tested on an android device. Therefore its look and feel on an android device is currently unclear. However it will soon be fully compatible with all platforms.

## Download link
The app is currently not published on the Play store or the iOS store but can be downloaded via the following link on Expo.

## Installation instructions
To test the app locally on your machine, download the repo and unzip the files.

Open the command line tool of your choice and navigate to the root level of the project './pokemonPokedex'. Then type the command:```expo start```
