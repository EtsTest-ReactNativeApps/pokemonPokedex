# Pokemon Pokedex
This is a React-Native application that uses the Pokemon TCG API by Andrew Backes.

The application fetches pokemon cards from the API and displays them. 

The user then has the capability of liking a pokemon card and adding it to their personal favorites.

Currently the app has been built for web and ios use and has yet to be tested on an android device. Therefore its look and feel on an android device is currently unclear. However it will soon be fully compatible with all platforms.
